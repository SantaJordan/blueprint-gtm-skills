Hi [Owner First Name],

I noticed on LinkedIn that your restaurant recently expanded your menu. Congrats on the growth!

I wanted to reach out because we work with restaurants like Talkin Tacos and Metro Pizza to help with online ordering and direct sales.

Our platform helps you own your customer relationships, reduce third-party commissions, and grow your direct online orders. We've helped restaurants increase their direct sales by up to 970%.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to explore how Owner.com might be able to help [Restaurant Name]?

Best,

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> The prospect is an expert. They've seen this template 1,000 times. There's zero indication you actually understand their specific situation. It's interruption disguised as personalization. Delete.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 3: The New Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The New Way: Intelligence-Driven GTM</h2>

            <p>Blueprint GTM flips the entire approach. Instead of interrupting prospects with pitches, you deliver insights so valuable they'd pay consulting fees to receive them. You become the person who helps them see around corners, not another vendor in their inbox.</p>

            <p>This requires two fundamental shifts:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">

                <p><strong>PQS (Pain-Qualified Segment):</strong> Reflect their exact situation with such specificity they think "how did you know?" Use verifiable data with exact numbers, growth rates, and infrastructure gaps.</p>

But your website has no native online ordering system (ran a BuiltWith scan). Your DoorDash menu shows a 28.3% average markup across 47 items, which at your review velocity likely means ~$4,200/month in platform fees.

High-activity restaurants without direct ordering infrastructure are leaving the most margin on the table. Worth exploring?</div>

That means every order goes through a platform taking 25-30% commission. Competitors with similar review velocity who added direct ordering typically recapture 15-25% of orders within 90 days, keeping 100% of that revenue. Should this go to you or your operations lead?</div>

Sept '24   | 58      | ~1,933      | ~$1,750

            <h2>The Transformation</h2>

            <p>Notice the difference? Traditional outreach talks about YOUR product and YOUR benefits. Blueprint GTM talks about THEIR situation and THEIR challenges using verifiable data they can look up themselves.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The shift is simple but profound:</strong></p>
                <p>Stop sending messages about what you do. Start sending intelligence about what they need to know right now. When you lead with "127 reviews in 30 days—top 12% in your metro" instead of "I see you expanded your menu," you're not another sales email—you're the person who actually did the research.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This isn't about templates or tactics. It's about building a systematic way to identify prospects experiencing specific, urgent challenges where Owner.com's solutions provide unique value—and proving you've done the homework with Google Maps review data, tech stack audits, and commission calculations.</p>

            <p>The companies that master this approach don't compete on features. They compete on intelligence.</p>
