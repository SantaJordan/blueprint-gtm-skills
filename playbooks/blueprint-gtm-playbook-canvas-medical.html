            <h1>Blueprint GTM Playbook for Canvas Medical</h1>

            <h2>Who the Hell is Jordan Crawford?</h2>

            <p>Founder of Blueprint GTM. Built a business by scraping 25M+ job posts to find company pain points. Believes the Predictable Revenue model is dead. Thinks mounting an AI SDR on outdated methodology is like putting a legless robot on a horse—no one gets anywhere, and it still shits along the way.</p>

            <p>The core philosophy is simple: The message isn't the problem. The LIST is the message. When you know exactly who to target and why they need you right now, the message writes itself.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2: The Old Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Old Way (What Everyone Does)</h2>

            <p>Let's be brutally honest about what Canvas Medical's GTM team might be doing right now. They're buying lists from ZoomInfo, filtering for "CTO" or "VP Engineering" at digital health companies, adding some "personalization" like mentioning a funding round from Crunchbase, then blasting generic messages about AI-native EMR architecture. Here's what it actually looks like:</p>

            <div class="old-way-example">
                <p><strong>The Typical Canvas Medical SDR Email:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: Congrats on your Series A!

Hi [CTO Name],

I noticed your company raised a Series A round last month - congrats! As you scale your digital health platform, you'll need EMR infrastructure that can keep up.

Canvas Medical is the AI-native EMR built for digital health innovators like you. Our Deep Unified Architecture™ seamlessly integrates clinical and administrative workflows, and our Canvas SDK gives your engineering team the developer control you need.

We've helped companies like Patina Health, Carda Health, and Fella Health scale from thousands to tens of thousands of patients without the limitations of legacy EMRs.

Do you have 20 minutes next week to discuss how Canvas could accelerate your roadmap?

Best,
[SDR Name]
Canvas Medical</div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> The CTO is an expert in EMR systems—they've evaluated dozens of vendors. They've seen "AI-native," "seamless integration," and "developer control" in every pitch deck. There's zero indication you actually understand their <em>specific</em> situation. Mentioning a Series A round? That's public information anyone can find. It's interruption disguised as personalization. Delete.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3: The New Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The New Way: Intelligence-Driven GTM</h2>

            <p>Blueprint GTM flips the entire approach. Instead of interrupting prospects with pitches, you deliver insights so valuable they'd pay consulting fees to receive them. You become the person who helps them see around corners, not another vendor in their inbox.</p>

            <p>This requires two fundamental shifts:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>1. Hard Data Over Soft Signals</h3>
                <p><strong>Stop:</strong> "I see you raised a Series A" (Crunchbase - everyone sees this, doesn't indicate specific pain)</p>
                <p><strong>Start:</strong> "Your EMR's CHPL surveillance (opened Aug 15, 2024, non-conformity NC-XXXX for § 170.315(e)(1) VDT) requires CAP completion by Dec 31, 2024" (ONC government database with exact dates, record numbers, and regulatory deadlines)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>2. Mirror Situations, Don't Pitch Solutions</h3>
                <p><strong>PQS (Pain-Qualified Segment):</strong> Reflect their exact situation with such specificity they think "how did you know?" Use government data with dates, record numbers, non-conformity IDs. Mirror the pain so precisely they can't ignore it.</p>
                <p><strong>PVP (Permissionless Value Proposition):</strong> Deliver immediate value they can use today - analysis already done, deadlines already pulled, regulatory timelines already calculated - whether they buy Canvas Medical or not. Prove you did the work.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 4: PQS Examples -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Canvas Medical PQS Plays: Mirroring Exact Situations</h2>

            <p>These messages demonstrate such precise understanding of the prospect's current situation that they feel genuinely seen. Every claim traces to a specific government database with verifiable record numbers. No fluff. No pitch. Just data that proves you did your homework.</p>

                <div class="why-section">
                    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Current EMR vendor likely can't fix non-conformities quickly enough, or wants $$$ for expedited remediation. Canvas offers pre-certified alternative with native ONC compliance. Deadline pressure creates urgency. Missing first deadline triggers 24-month mandatory quarterly reporting—a consequence most CTOs don't know.</p>

Most companies we've seen miss that first remediation deadline and get extended 60 days - but that triggers mandatory quarterly reporting for 24 months.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Transformation</h2>

            <p>Notice the difference? Traditional outreach talks about YOUR product ("Canvas is AI-native," "Our SDK gives you control") and YOUR benefits ("seamless workflows," "developer-friendly"). Blueprint GTM talks about THEIR situation ("Your EMR's CHPL surveillance opened Aug 15, 2024") and THEIR challenges (CAP deadline Dec 31, OCR investigation timeline 18-24 months) using verifiable data they can look up themselves.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The shift is simple but profound:</strong></p>
                <p>Stop sending messages about what you do. Start sending intelligence about what they need to know right now. When you lead with "CHPL surveillance opened Aug 15, 2024, non-conformity NC-XXXX for § 170.315(e)(1)" instead of "I see you raised a Series A," you're not another sales email—you're the person who actually did the research in the ONC government database.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This isn't about templates or tactics. It's about building a systematic way to identify prospects experiencing specific, urgent challenges where Canvas Medical's solutions provide unique value—and proving you've done the homework with government database record numbers, exact dates, and regulatory deadlines.</p>

            <p>Canvas Medical competes on <strong>developer control + compliance certification</strong>—a rare combination. Legacy EMRs (Epic, Athena, Cerner) have certification but lock you in with zero developer control. Homegrown or basic EMRs (Practice Fusion, Kareo) give flexibility but lack ONC certification for CMS participation. Canvas's unique position enables targeting companies hitting specific compliance walls (ONC audit failures) or security crises (EMR breaches) where the current vendor has failed them.</p>

            <p>The companies that master this approach don't compete on features. They compete on intelligence. They know exactly who needs them and why—before the prospect even realizes they have a problem.</p>

                <h3>Your Next Steps</h3>
                <p><strong>1. Access the Government Databases:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li>ONC CHPL API: <a href="https://chpl.healthit.gov/" style="color: var(--print-blue);">https://chpl.healthit.gov/</a></li>
                    <li>OCR Breach Portal: <a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf" style="color: var(--print-blue);">https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>2. Build Your Target Lists:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li>Query CHPL for products with surveillance_status = "Open" OR non_conformity_status = "Open"</li>
                    <li>Export OCR breaches from past 6-18 months where location = "Electronic Medical Record"</li>
                    <li>Filter for digital health companies (exclude large health systems >500 employees)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>3. Execute with Precision:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                    <li>Use exact dates, record numbers, and regulatory citations from government data</li>
                    <li>Deliver value first (timelines, deadlines, consequences) before asking anything</li>
                    <li>Make replies brain-dead easy ("Who should I send this to?" not "Can we schedule a call?")</li>
                </ul>
