# Buyer Evaluation Rubric for Gold Standard PVPs

**Purpose:** Evaluate PVP concepts and messages from the buyer's perspective with brutal honesty, ensuring only 8.0+ quality PVPs are delivered.

**When to Use:** Phase 3 of PVP generation, IMMEDIATELY after drafting each PVP concept + message pair.

**Key Principle:** Evaluate as the BUYER, not as a marketer. If your reaction is "maybe" - that's a NO.

---

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Persona Adoption (Mandatory)

Before evaluating ANY message, you MUST adopt the persona completely:

```
"I am [SPECIFIC JOB TITLE from Wave 1] at [TYPICAL ICP COMPANY].

My responsibilities today include: [FROM WAVE 1 RESEARCH]

My KPIs this quarter are: [FROM WAVE 1 RESEARCH]

The biggest problems on my desk right now: [FROM WAVE 1 PAINS]

I receive 50+ unsolicited sales emails per day. I delete 95% within 2 seconds based on subject line alone. Of the 5% I open, I reply to maybe 1%.

I ONLY respond to emails that:
1. Mirror an EXACT situation I'm experiencing RIGHT NOW
2. Contain data I can verify myself AND don't already have
3. Offer a non-obvious insight I genuinely haven't considered
4. Require minimal effort from me to get value or respond

I am NOT evaluating this as a sales professional or marketer.
I AM THE BUSY BUYER WHO GETS TOO MANY EMAILS.

If my gut reaction is 'maybe useful' or 'interesting' - that means NO, I won't reply."
```

**Critical:** Stay in character throughout the entire evaluation. Don't slip back into "marketer evaluating a message" mode.

## Scoring Rubric

Score each PVP message on 7 criteria, each rated 1-10:

### 1. Situation Recognition (1-10)

**Question:** Does this mirror my EXACT current situation with specific, verifiable details?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (Generic / Wrong):**
- Describes a situation that doesn't apply to me
- Uses vague language ("many companies", "recent trends")
- No specific details I can verify
- Example: "Many operations managers struggle with efficiency"

**4-6 (Relevant but Vague):**
- Describes my general industry/role
- Some specifics but not MY specific situation
- Could apply to 1000+ companies
- Example: "Restaurant operators in your area face rising costs"

**7-8 (Highly Specific):**
- Contains details that clearly match my situation
- Specific data points I can verify
- Applies to me and maybe 10-50 others
- Example: "Your facility at 1234 Main St received EPA violation #987654 on March 15"

**9-10 (Hyper-Specific / Uncanny):**
- Feels like they're looking at my internal systems
- Multiple verifiable details that are DEFINITELY about me
- Would only apply to me and 1-5 others
- Creates "how did they know that?" reaction
- Example: "Your Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 doesn't seem to be currently in use (couldn't find a Texas DOT permit)"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [Why this score? What's specific or missing?]
- [Can I verify these details? How?]
- [Does this feel like it's about ME or just my industry?]

---

### 2. Data Credibility (1-10)

**Question:** Can I trust this data? Can I verify it myself? Does it come from a legitimate source?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (Questionable / Unverifiable):**
- No source mentioned
- Claims seem inflated or too perfect
- Can't verify the data myself
- Feels like they're guessing
- Example: "Based on our analysis, you could save $50K"

**4-6 (Plausible but Unproven):**
- Vague source reference ("industry data", "our research")
- Data seems reasonable but can't verify
- Mix of verifiable and unverifiable claims
- Example: "Industry reports show 30% inefficiency in your sector"

**7-8 (Credible & Verifiable):**
- Specific source mentioned (database name, API)
- Can verify key claims myself with reasonable effort
- Numbers are specific (not rounded)
- Feels grounded in real data
- Example: "EPA ECHO violation #987654321 on March 15, 2025"

**9-10 (Ironclad / Government-Grade):**
- Official government database referenced
- Specific record numbers, dates, field values provided
- Can verify in under 5 minutes
- No inference, just pure data
- Creates "they did their homework" reaction
- Example: "NYC DOHMH inspection on 3/15/25, CAMIS #987654, critical flag for cold holding temp 47°F"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [What's the data source? Can I verify it?]
- [Does this feel like real data or marketing fluff?]
- [How long would it take me to verify key claims?]
- [Any red flags in the numbers or claims?]

---

### 3. Insight Value (1-10)

**Question:** Is this a non-obvious synthesis I genuinely don't know? Does it make me think differently?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (Obvious / Already Know):**
- Information I definitely already have
- States problems I'm well aware of
- No new perspective
- Example: "Your industry faces compliance challenges"

**4-6 (Somewhat New but Not Actionable):**
- Information I probably knew vaguely
- Interesting but doesn't change my thinking
- Obvious conclusion from the data
- Example: "Your violation count is above average"

**7-8 (Non-Obvious / Valuable):**
- Information I didn't have or haven't synthesized
- Connects dots I hadn't connected
- Changes how I think about the problem
- Makes me want to investigate further
- Example: "Your Q1 violations cluster in a pattern suggesting training gap with night shift (87% occur 8pm-4am)"

**9-10 (Revelation / "Holy Shit"):**
- Information I definitely don't have and can't easily get
- Synthesis across multiple data sources I don't have access to
- Immediately actionable insight
- Changes my priorities for the week
- Creates "I need to look into this NOW" reaction
- Example: "Maxwell Construction just filed permits for wind turbines requiring YOUR specific crane model, available to start next week for $45K-180K rental"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [Do I already know this information?]
- [Is this a new perspective or synthesis?]
- [Does this change how I think about the problem?]
- [What's the information asymmetry they're bridging?]

---

### 4. Actionability (1-10)

**Question:** Is there a clear, specific action I can take right now? Or is this just information?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (No Action / Just Information):**
- Describes a problem but offers no solution
- "Something to think about"
- Would need to reply to get any value
- Example: "Your compliance record raises concerns"

**4-6 (Vague Action):**
- Suggests general direction but not specific steps
- Action requires significant work from me
- Example: "You should explore better training programs"

**7-8 (Clear Action):**
- Specific next step is obvious
- Requires moderate effort from me
- Know exactly what to do next
- Example: "Contact Maxwell Construction about crane rental - owner Max, max@maxwellconstruction.com"

**9-10 (Immediate Action / Complete Info):**
- Can act in next 5 minutes
- All information needed is in the message
- Zero additional research required
- Complete contact info, timing, pricing, etc.
- Example: "Call Sheila Gibbs at 405-532-3212 about the $2K flooring credit at 18904 Bajo Dr closing Oct 22"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [What specific action can I take?]
- [Do I have all info needed to act?]
- [How much effort is required from me?]
- [Can I act without replying to this email?]

---

### 5. Recipient Effort (1-10)

**Question:** How easy is it for me to get value from this or respond? How much friction is there?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (High Friction):**
- Need to schedule a meeting to learn more
- Requires significant analysis from me
- Multiple steps to get value
- Example: "Let's schedule a call to discuss your compliance strategy"

**4-6 (Moderate Effort):**
- Need to do some research or thinking
- Reply requires more than one sentence
- Some mental processing required
- Example: "Let me know which features you'd find most useful"

**7-8 (Low Effort):**
- Can reply with simple yes/no or one sentence
- Value is clear without additional work
- Minimal cognitive load
- Example: "Want the list of violations?" → "Yes"

**9-10 (Instant Value / Zero Effort):**
- Get value by just reading the email
- If I reply, it's one word: "Yes" or "Thanks"
- No thinking required
- Can forward directly to relevant person
- Example: "P.S. The listing agent is Sheila Gibbs. You can reach her at sheila@gibbshomesales.com"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [What effort is required from me?]
- [Can I get value without replying?]
- [If I reply, how complex is my response?]
- [Any cognitive load or analysis required?]

---

### 6. Impact & Urgency (1-10)

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (No Clear Impact):**
- Doesn't connect to my KPIs or money
- "Nice to know" information
- No timeline or urgency
- Example: "Industry trends suggest future challenges"

**4-6 (Indirect Impact):**

- Example: "Consent decree deadline June 30 (89 days) with penalties $10K/day for non-compliance"

**9-10 (Critical & Urgent):**
- Immediate revenue opportunity or cost savings
- Specific dollar amounts that matter to me
- Time-sensitive (days/weeks, not months)
- Miss this = real consequences
- Creates "I need to act on this today" feeling

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [How does this affect my KPIs or budget?]
- [What's the quantifiable impact?]
- [What's the timeline? Why does this matter now?]
- [What happens if I ignore this?]

- No emotional reaction
- Feels like every other sales email
- Boring
- Example: "We help companies improve operations"

- [Would I forward this to anyone?]
- [Will I remember this email tomorrow?]

## Overall Scoring

### Calculate Average Score

Sum all 7 criteria scores and divide by 7:

**Average Score = (S1 + S2 + S3 + S4 + S5 + S6 + S7) ÷ 7**

### Apply Gold Standard Threshold

**8.0-10.0:** ✅ **GOLD STANDARD PVP** - KEEP
- This is exceptional
- I would definitely reply or act
- Passes "Holy Shit" test
- Keep as-is or with minor polish

**7.0-7.9:** ⚠️ **STRONG PQS** - REVISE OR RECLASSIFY
- This is good, not great
- I might reply on a good day
- Solid pain identification but not complete PVP
- Consider: Can this be improved to 8.0+? Or reclassify as Strong PQS?

**<7.0:** ❌ **DESTROY**
- Would not reply
- Something fundamental is wrong
- Don't try to fix - start over with different concept

---

## Additional Tests

After scoring, apply these reality checks:

### The "Forwarding Test"
**Question:** Would I forward this email to a colleague or my boss?
- ✅ YES → Strong signal of value
- ❌ NO → Probably not impactful enough

### The "Tomorrow Test"
**Question:** Will I remember receiving this email tomorrow?
- ✅ YES → Memorable and valuable
- ❌ NO → Forgettable, probably scores <8.0

### The "Competitor Test"
**Question:** If my competitor sent me this instead of a vendor, would I act?
- ✅ YES → Genuinely valuable insight
- ❌ NO → Feels like sales pitch

### The "Meeting Test"
**Question:** Would I need a meeting to get value from this?
- ✅ NO → True PVP, independently useful
- ❌ YES → Actually a lead generation email, not PVP

---

## Common Failure Modes

Watch for these red flags that indicate fake PVPs:

### 🚩 The "So What?" Problem
- Provides data but no insight
- I already knew this
- Not actionable
- **Fix:** Add non-obvious synthesis or specific action

### 🚩 The "Trust Me Bro" Problem
- Claims I can't verify
- Vague sources ("our research", "industry data")
- Feels like guessing
- **Fix:** Use verifiable government data or cite specific sources

### 🚩 The "Call Me" Problem
- Buries value behind a meeting request
- "Let's discuss how we can help"
- Not independently useful
- **Fix:** Provide value in the email itself

### 🚩 The "Everyone" Problem
- Could apply to 10,000 companies
- Generic industry trends
- Not about ME specifically
- **Fix:** Add hyper-specific data points about this recipient

### 🚩 The "Obvious" Problem
- States something I definitely already know
- No new perspective
- Wastes my time
- **Fix:** Find the non-obvious connection or insight

### 🚩 The "Effort" Problem
- Requires significant work from me
- Complex CTA
- Mental gymnastics to understand value
- **Fix:** Make action dead simple and value instant

```

---

## Key Principles

1. **Stay in character** - You are the BUYER, not evaluating as a marketer
2. **"Maybe" = NO** - If you're not sure you'd reply, you wouldn't
3. **Be brutal** - Better to destroy 10 mediocre PVPs than ship 1 bad one
4. **Specificity matters** - Vague = low score
5. **Verify = trust** - If you can't verify, score drops
6. **Effort = friction** - High effort = low score
7. **8.0+ or bust** - Gold Standard threshold is non-negotiable

---
