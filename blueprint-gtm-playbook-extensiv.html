            <p>Founder of Blueprint GTM. Built a business by scraping 25M+ job posts to find company pain points. Believes the Predictable Revenue model is dead. Thinks mounting an AI SDR on outdated methodology is like putting a legless robot on a horse—no one gets anywhere, and it still shits along the way.</p>

            <p>The core philosophy is simple: The message isn't the problem. The LIST is the message. When you know exactly who to target and why they need you right now, the message writes itself.</p>

Hi [First Name],

I noticed on LinkedIn that your company recently expanded to a new location. Congrats on the growth!

I wanted to reach out because we work with 3PLs like ShipBob and Fulfillment.com to help with warehouse management challenges.

Our platform provides real-time inventory tracking, automated billing, and seamless integrations with 100+ shopping carts. We've helped companies achieve 25% labor cost reductions and 99% picking accuracy.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to explore how Extensiv might be able to help your operations?

The repeat pattern—all forklift-related under §1910.178—puts you in the top 15% of warehousing citations for the region. With your Garland facility expansion permit filed last month, you're likely flagged for enhanced scrutiny.
