            <h2>Who the Hell is Jordan Crawford?</h2>

            <p>Founder of Blueprint GTM. Built a business by scraping 25M+ job posts to find company pain points. Believes the Predictable Revenue model is dead. Thinks mounting an AI SDR on outdated methodology is like putting a legless robot on a horse—no one gets anywhere, and it still shits along the way.</p>

            <p>The core philosophy is simple: The message isn't the problem. The LIST is the message. When you know exactly who to target and why they need you right now, the message writes itself.</p>

            <h2>The Old Way (What Everyone Does)</h2>

            <p>Let's be brutally honest about what your GTM team is doing right now. They're buying lists from ZoomInfo, adding some "personalization" like mentioning a LinkedIn post, then blasting generic messages about features. Here's what it actually looks like:</p>

                <div class="message-example">Subject: Quick Question about Prior Authorizations

Hi Dr. Martinez,

I noticed your oncology practice has been growing—congrats on the expansion!

I wanted to reach out because we work with specialty practices like Memorial Cancer Center and Bay Area Oncology to help streamline prior authorizations.

Our AI-powered platform automates PA form selection, answer generation, and payer follow-ups. We've helped practices achieve 5x throughput and 14% more approvals.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to explore how Develop Health might be able to help your practice?

Best,
Generic SDR</div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> The prospect is an expert in prior authorization pain—they live it every day. There's zero indication you understand THEIR specific PA burden, THEIR drug mix, or THEIR patient volume. It's interruption disguised as personalization. Delete.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The New Way: Intelligence-Driven GTM</h2>

            <p>Blueprint GTM flips the entire approach. Instead of interrupting prospects with pitches, you deliver insights so valuable they'd pay consulting fees to receive them. You become the person who helps them see around corners, not another vendor in their inbox.</p>

                <p><strong>PQS (Pain-Qualified Segment):</strong> Reflect their exact PA burden with such specificity they think "how did you know?" Use CMS Part D data with claim counts, drug names, and beneficiary volumes.</p>

CMS shows your practice prescribed 423 biologic medication claims (adalimumab, infliximab, rituximab) in 2022—that's top 15th percentile in your state for rheumatology practices. Biologics carry 95%+ PA requirement rates industry-wide, meaning approximately 402 prior authorizations from biologics alone last year.

Each biologic PA averages 50 minutes (step therapy documentation, prior treatment history, clinical notes). That's 335 staff-hours annually on biologic PAs.

I pulled your 2022 CMS Part D data—your practice prescribed 847 oncology medication claims to 312 Medicare beneficiaries last year. At AMA's benchmark of 39 prior authorizations per physician weekly for specialty practices, that's roughly 2,028 PAs annually for your 2-physician practice.

At 45 minutes average per oncology PA (step therapy documentation, clinical notes, payer follow-ups), your team is spending an estimated 1,521 hours/year on PA alone.

I ran your NPI through CMS Part D data—you served 1,847 Medicare beneficiaries last year, ranking 23rd out of 412 oncology practices in California. That beneficiary volume puts you in the top 6% for Medicare patient load in your specialty.

Based on your prescription mix (482 claims across 47 unique drugs), your estimated annual PA volume is 2,340—73% higher than the state median for oncology practices.

I can send the full specialty drug breakdown by PA requirement rate if useful. Who manages PA workflow at your practice?</div>

I analyzed your CMS Part D prescribing—your top 5 drugs by volume (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, rituximab, carboplatin, paclitaxel) have a combined 89% PA requirement rate based on formulary data. That's 376 of your 423 specialty claims requiring prior authorization.

Here's what stands out: pembrolizumab alone (127 claims) requires PA 97% of the time with average approval turnaround of 6.2 days. I can send the full drug-level PA analysis with approval time benchmarks.
