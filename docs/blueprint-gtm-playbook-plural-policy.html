            <p>Let's be brutally honest about what a typical government affairs software SDR is doing right now. They're buying lists of "VP Government Relations" titles from ZoomInfo, adding some "personalization" like mentioning a company expansion, then blasting generic messages about features. Here's what it actually looks like:</p>

                <div class="message-example">Subject: Quick Question about Legislative Tracking

Hi Sarah,

I noticed on LinkedIn that Acme Manufacturing recently expanded operations into three new states. Congrats on the growth!

I wanted to reach out because we work with companies like Google and Comcast to help with legislative tracking and policy intelligence.

Plural Policy's AI-powered platform provides bill summaries, momentum indicators, and cross-jurisdictional monitoring. We've helped companies track 50,000+ bills across all 50 states.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to explore how we might be able to help Acme stay ahead of regulatory changes?

Best,
Generic SDR</div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> The prospect is a VP of Government Relations—they've seen this template 1,000 times. "Expanded into new states" is a soft signal anyone can see. There's zero indication you understand their SPECIFIC regulatory situation. It's interruption disguised as personalization. Delete.</p>
