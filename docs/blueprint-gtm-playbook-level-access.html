                <div class="message-example">Subject: Quick Question About Accessibility

Hi [First Name],

I noticed your company is in the e-commerce space and wanted to reach out. With digital accessibility becoming more important than ever, many companies like yours are looking for ways to ensure their websites are compliant with ADA and WCAG standards.

Level Access helps companies like [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2] achieve digital accessibility through our comprehensive platform that includes automated testing, remediation tools, and expert guidance.

We've helped companies reduce accessibility issues by up to 70% and avoid costly lawsuits.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to discuss how we might be able to help [Company]?

Best,
Generic SDR</div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> The prospect is an expert in getting pitched accessibility tools. They've seen "ADA compliance" and "avoid costly lawsuits" in 500 emails. There's zero indication you actually understand whether THEY have accessibility issues, or what those issues specifically are. It's interruption disguised as concern. Delete.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 3: The New Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The New Way: Intelligence-Driven GTM</h2>

            <p>Blueprint GTM flips the entire approach. Instead of interrupting prospects with pitches, you deliver insights so valuable they'd pay consulting fees to receive them. You become the person who helps them see around corners, not another vendor in their inbox.</p>

            <p>This requires two fundamental shifts:</p>

                <p><strong>Start:</strong> "Your site has UserWay installed since March 2023, but axe-core still shows 67 WCAG violations including 12 critical keyboard failures on checkout" (actual audit data with specific tool names and counts)</p>

The gut punch: "You probably bought the overlay thinking you were covered. You're not."</p>

I ran your site through axe-core.

UserWay's been on [yourdomain].com since March 2023. But the automated audit found 67 WCAG 2.1 Level AA violations—including 12 critical keyboard navigation failures on checkout. UserWay doesn't fix those. Neither does accessiBe.

25% of 2024 ADA lawsuits targeted companies with widgets installed. FTC just fined accessiBe $1M for claiming they deliver compliance.

You probably bought the overlay thinking you were covered. You're not.

                    <p><strong>What's the play?</strong> Target overlay users with a legal angle - 41% of 2024 lawsuits were repeat suits against companies that had already been sued.

Quick note—41% of 2024 ADA lawsuits were against companies that had already been sued before.

I checked [yourdomain].com. You've got [accessiBe/UserWay] running, but axe-core still shows 43 open violations including form labels and color contrast failures. Those are exactly what plaintiffs cite in complaints.

Serial plaintiff firms like Stein Saks filed 395 lawsuits in 2024 alone. They're specifically targeting e-commerce sites with widgets because it proves the company knew about accessibility but didn't actually fix it.

Fashion/retail e-commerce accounts for 35% of all ADA lawsuits. Sites with this violation profile are exactly what serial plaintiff firms target.

I audited accessibility across 5 sites in your space:

[Competitor 2]: Lighthouse 71/100, 38 violations
[Competitor 3]: Lighthouse 65/100, 52 violations
[yourdomain]: Lighthouse 52/100, 67 violations
[Competitor 4]: Lighthouse 49/100, 74 violations

You're 4th out of 5. The gap is checkout flow—competitors 1-3 all have keyboard-accessible purchase paths. Yours requires mouse input at payment step.

The company with the worst score usually gets sued first. It's easier plaintiff math.
