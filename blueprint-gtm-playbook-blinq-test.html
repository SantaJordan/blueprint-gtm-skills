            <h1>Blueprint GTM Playbook for Blinq</h1>

            <h2>Who the Hell is Jordan Crawford?</h2>

            <p>Founder of Blueprint GTM. Built a business by scraping 25M+ job posts to find company pain points. Believes the Predictable Revenue model is dead. Thinks mounting an AI SDR on outdated methodology is like putting a legless robot on a horse—no one gets anywhere, and it still shits along the way.</p>

            <p>The core philosophy is simple: The message isn't the problem. The LIST is the message. When you know exactly who to target and why they need you right now, the message writes itself.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2: Product-Fit Analysis (NEW) -->

            <h2>Product-Fit Analysis: Why This Playbook is Different</h2>

            <p><strong>Blinq sells digital business cards.</strong> This is a horizontal product—it serves any business, not specific regulated industries. The old approach would have found data-rich niches like insurance agents (NIPR database) and generated messages about CE deadlines and license cascades.</p>

                <p><strong>The old system would have generated messages like:</strong> "Your CE deadline is in 45 days and you have 14 licenses across 3 states..."</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Digital business cards don't solve CE compliance. Excellent data, zero product-fit.</p>

            <div class="success-box">
                <h3>What We GENERATED Instead (Gate 5 Pass)</h3>
                <p>We pivoted to <strong>situation-based plays</strong> that connect DATA → SITUATION → PAIN → PRODUCT:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rebrand Transition:</strong> Companies that just rebranded have obsolete printed cards → Digital cards update instantly</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Onboarding Scale:</strong> Companies hiring fast can't provision cards fast enough → Digital cards deploy in 2 minutes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These segments pass Gate 5 because <strong>digital business cards ARE the direct solution</strong> to these timing problems.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 3: The Old Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Old Way (What Everyone Does)</h2>

            <p>Let's be brutally honest about what your GTM team is doing right now. They're buying lists from ZoomInfo, adding some "personalization" like mentioning a LinkedIn post, then blasting generic messages about features. Here's what it actually looks like:</p>

            <div class="old-way-example">
                <p><strong>The Typical Blinq SDR Email:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: Quick Question about [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

I noticed on LinkedIn that [Company Name] recently expanded your sales team. Congrats on the growth!

I wanted to reach out because we work with companies like Hilton and McKinsey to help sales teams share contact information more efficiently.

Blinq offers digital business cards that let you share your info via QR code, NFC, or Apple Wallet. We've helped companies save 50% on printing costs.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to explore how we might be able to help [Company Name]?

Best,
Generic SDR</div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> The prospect is an expert. They've seen this template 1,000 times. "Companies like Hilton and McKinsey" doesn't prove you understand THEIR situation. It's interruption disguised as personalization. Delete.</p>

Your rebrand from [OldName] to [NewCo] was announced November 8th. Your team likely still has boxes of [OldName] cards—and reprinting 200+ employee cards takes 2-3 weeks plus $4-8 per person.

With digital cards, one admin update pushes the new brand to everyone's Apple Wallet instantly. No reprints, no obsolete inventory.

Saw [NewCo]'s rebrand announcement on [date]. Quick question: are you reprinting business cards for the whole team, or going digital?

Most companies discover mid-rebrand that printed cards create a 3-week delay between "new brand approved" and "cards in hands." Digital cards update in 60 seconds.

                <h3>Play 2: Open Roles Signal</h3>

                <div class="play-explanation">
                    <p><strong>What's the play?</strong> Target companies with 15+ open client-facing roles. If even half fill in the next quarter, that's a card provisioning challenge coming. Offer a proactive ROI comparison before they hit the wall.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="why-section">
                    <p><strong>Why this works (Score: 7.6/10):</strong> Job postings are public data. Client-facing roles (sales, account management, customer success) definitionally need business cards. The offer of an ROI comparison is concrete value, not a vague meeting request.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="data-sources">
                    <strong>Data sources:</strong> Company careers page, Indeed API, LinkedIn Jobs, Greenhouse/Lever public job boards

                <p><strong>The message:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: scaling card provisioning

Your careers page shows 23 open client-facing roles (12 sales, 6 account management, 5 customer success). If even half fill in the next quarter, that's 12 new employees who need business cards before their first customer meeting.

I put together a quick ROI comparison: print cards at $6/person with 2-week lead time vs. digital at $4/person with instant provisioning. For a team scaling like yours, the time savings alone is worth a look.

Want me to send the comparison, or does your ops team handle this?</div>

            <h2>The Transformation</h2>

            <p>Notice the difference? These messages don't talk about CE deadlines, license renewals, or carrier appointments—because digital business cards don't solve those problems. Instead, they target <strong>situations where timing creates genuine need</strong>:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The key insight for horizontal products:</strong></p>
                <p>You can't force product-fit onto data-rich verticals. Insurance agents have excellent NIPR data, but their pain is compliance—not business cards. Instead, find the <strong>timing triggers</strong> that make your product necessary RIGHT NOW: rebrands, rapid hiring, conferences, office moves.</p>
            </div>

            <table class="gate-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Old Approach</th>
                    <th>New Approach</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Find data-rich vertical (insurance agents)</td>
                    <td>Validate product-fit FIRST (Gate 5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Generate messages about vertical pain (CE deadlines)</td>
                    <td>Generate messages about timing situations (rebrand)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>High data score, zero product relevance</td>
                    <td>Moderate data score, direct product connection</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Prospect thinks "why are you telling me about my licenses?"</td>
                    <td>Prospect thinks "oh yeah, we DO need to solve the card problem"</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>This isn't about templates or tactics. It's about ensuring every segment connects DATA → SITUATION → PAIN → PRODUCT. When the product IS the solution to the identified pain, the message writes itself.</p>

            <p>The companies that master this approach don't compete on features. They compete on timing intelligence.</p>
