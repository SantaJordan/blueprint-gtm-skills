            <p>Founder of Blueprint GTM. Built a business by scraping 25M+ job posts to find company pain points. Believes the Predictable Revenue model is dead. Thinks mounting an AI SDR on outdated methodology is like putting a legless robot on a horse—no one gets anywhere, and it still shits along the way.</p>

            <p>The core philosophy is simple: The message isn't the problem. The LIST is the message. When you know exactly who to target and why they need you right now, the message writes itself.</p>

            <p>Let's be brutally honest about what your GTM team is doing right now. They're buying lists from ZoomInfo, adding some "personalization" like mentioning a LinkedIn post, then blasting generic messages about features. Here's what it actually looks like:</p>

                <div class="message-example">Subject: Quick question about your lending process

Hi [First Name],

I noticed that [Credit Union Name] has been growing its commercial lending portfolio. Congrats on the expansion!

I wanted to reach out because we work with credit unions like yours to streamline the commercial lending process. Our AI-powered platform helps relationship managers collect documents faster and reduce loan cycle times.

Companies like Able and GoDocs have seen 30-40% improvements in efficiency using similar solutions.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to explore how Interfold might help [Credit Union Name] achieve similar results?

Best,
Generic SDR</div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> The Chief Lending Officer has seen this template 1,000 times. "Growing commercial lending" is visible to anyone who can read a call report. There's zero indication you actually understand their specific regulatory constraints, capacity challenges, or examination pressures. It's interruption disguised as personalization. Delete.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3: The New Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The New Way: Intelligence-Driven GTM</h2>

            <p>Blueprint GTM flips the entire approach. Instead of interrupting prospects with pitches, you deliver insights so valuable they'd pay consulting fees to receive them. You become the person who helps them see around corners, not another vendor in their inbox.</p>

            <p>This requires two fundamental shifts:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>1. Hard Data Over Soft Signals</h3>
                <p><strong>Stop:</strong> "I see you're growing your commercial lending" (everyone can see this in call reports)</p>
                <p><strong>Start:</strong> "Your $47.2M in MBL represents 10.8% of assets—1.45 points from the statutory cap" (NCUA Call Report with specific calculations)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>2. Mirror Situations, Don't Pitch Solutions</h3>
                <p><strong>PQS (Pain-Qualified Segment):</strong> Reflect their exact regulatory situation with such specificity they think "how did you know?" Use NCUA/FDIC data with exact balances, ratios, and peer comparisons.</p>

                <div class="play-explanation">
                    <p><strong>What's the play?</strong> Target credit unions with member business loan (MBL) balances at 10%+ of assets—approaching the statutory 12.25% cap. These institutions face a hard ceiling on commercial growth and need operational efficiency to maximize value within the constraint. Calculate their exact runway and connect capacity constraints to document collection bottlenecks.</p>

                <div class="why-section">
                    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> The MBL cap is existential for commercial-focused credit unions. By calculating their exact runway (17 months in the example), you demonstrate you've done the math they may not have done themselves. The connection between "hitting the cap" and "freeing RM capacity" is non-obvious—they're focused on loan growth, not process efficiency. Scored 9/10 on situation recognition and 9/10 on impact/urgency in buyer evaluation.</p>

Your $47.2M in member business loans represents 10.8% of your $437M in assets—just 1.45 percentage points from the statutory 12.25% cap. At your current 8.3% MBL growth rate, you'll hit the ceiling in approximately 17 months.

Credit unions in this position typically face a choice: slow commercial growth or find operational efficiencies. Document collection automation typically frees 40-50% of relationship manager time currently spent chasing borrower financials.

In your next exam, examiners will specifically assess documentation quality, underwriting standards, and portfolio monitoring as risk management indicators. Banks with strong documentation practices consistently receive fewer MRAs in CRE-concentration examinations.

The "33% rise in delinquency" framing is more alarming than "28 bps increase" and creates urgency.

Your commercial loan book grew 7.2% year-over-year while your noncurrent loan ratio increased from 0.84% to 1.12%—a 33% rise in delinquency rate. This combination often indicates portfolio monitoring gaps: growth outpacing your team's ability to track covenant compliance and early warning signs.

The loans going delinquent today likely showed financial deterioration 6-12 months ago in their financial statements. Automated spreading and covenant tracking typically catches these signals before they become 90+ day delinquencies.

                <div class="play-explanation">
                    <p><strong>What's the play?</strong> Target banks with efficiency ratios significantly above their peer group median. Calculate the specific dollar gap (not just basis points) to make the inefficiency visceral. Connect the gap to highest-volume manual processes like document collection.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="why-section">
                    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> "$847K annually in excess operating costs" is far more compelling than "630 bps above peer." Quantifying inefficiency in dollars creates budget conversation material. The connection to document collection (15-20 hours per loan) provides a specific, actionable efficiency lever. Scored 9/10 on emotional resonance (dollar amount is visceral) and 9/10 on impact/urgency (board-level concern). Tied for top score at 8.6/10.</p>

                <p><strong>The message:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: $847K efficiency gap

Your efficiency ratio of 74.1% versus your $250M-$500M peer median of 67.8% represents a 630 basis point gap. On your $12.4M in non-interest expense, that gap equals approximately $847,000 annually in excess operating costs.

Banks closing this gap typically start with their highest-touch, highest-volume processes. Commercial loan document collection averages 23 hours of RM time per loan at banks your size—automating this single process has reduced efficiency ratios by 100-150 basis points at similar institutions.

                <h3>Play 3: ADC Concentration</h3>

                <div class="play-explanation">
                    <p><strong>What's the play?</strong> Target banks with Acquisition, Development & Construction (ADC) loans above 100% of risk-based capital—the threshold from regulatory guidance. ADC loans are inherently more complex than stabilized CRE and require active monitoring of draw schedules, interest reserves, and completion milestones.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="why-section">
                    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Construction lending is high-touch and high-risk. Banks with ADC concentration know they have exposure, but the "surprise at maturity" framing triggers fear of exactly the scenario that keeps Chief Credit Officers up at night. The specific monitoring checklist offer provides immediate, actionable value.</p>

                <p><strong>The message:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: 127% ADC concentration

Your $48.7M in acquisition, development, and construction loans against $38.3M in risk-based capital represents 127% ADC concentration—above the 100% threshold that triggers heightened regulatory scrutiny. And your ADC portfolio grew 14% year-over-year.

ADC loans are inherently more volatile than stabilized CRE: draw schedules, interest reserves, completion milestones, and lease-up phases all require active monitoring. Construction loans that "surprise" lenders at maturity typically showed warning signs 6+ months earlier in draw request patterns.

            <h2>The Transformation</h2>

            <p>Notice the difference? Traditional outreach talks about YOUR product and YOUR benefits. Blueprint GTM talks about THEIR situation and THEIR challenges using verifiable regulatory data they can look up themselves.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The shift is simple but profound:</strong></p>
                <p>Stop sending messages about what you do. Start sending intelligence about what they need to know right now. When you lead with "$47.2M MBL at 10.8% of assets—17 months from the cap" instead of "I see you're growing commercial lending," you're not another sales email—you're the person who actually did the math using their NCUA Call Report data.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This isn't about templates or tactics. It's about building a systematic way to identify banks and credit unions experiencing specific, urgent challenges—MBL cap pressure, CRE concentration scrutiny, portfolio quality tension—where Interfold's document automation and portfolio monitoring solutions provide unique value.</p>
